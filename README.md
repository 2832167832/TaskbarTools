# TaskbarTools
Grants the ability to set the Windows Taskbars to any opacity and colour desired. This will affect the Taskbars on every monitor/desktop, not only the primary.

Feel free to branch and add features as you like!

# Credits 
Reddit user IronManMark20 started a C++ project to make the Taskbar transparent.
Elestriel then ported it to C#, slapped a UI on it, and added a few features.
