# TaskbarTools
Grants the ability to set the Windows Taskbars to any opacity and colour desired. This will affect the Taskbars on every monitor/desktop, not only the primary.

Feel free to branch and add features as you like!

# Need an Icon!
If anyone out there with some graphic design skills would like to create an icon for the app, it would be tremendously appreciated. It's just using a 1-UP Mushroom for now, since I couldn't think of anything better. I'd love to see something unique instead. The icon would have to be at least 256x256!
